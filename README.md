# nestjs start

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

Build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.


`nest g controller cats`

**Controllers** always belong to a module, which is why we include the controllers array within the @Module() decorator

Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on.
