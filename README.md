# nestjs start

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

**Controllers** are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.

`nest g controller cats`

**Controllers** always belong to a module, which is why we include the controllers array within the @Module() decorator

Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on.
